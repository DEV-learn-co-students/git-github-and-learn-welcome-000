# Git, Github And Learn

## What is Git?

When you write code, just like writing text documents, it's *really* convenient (and in fact often essential!) to be able to go back to a previous version of your code. For instance, if you realize that a change you made was actuallyl undesirable and you want to "roll back" to a past version. In order for this to be possible you need to be able to save your work as you go and manage different versions of your code. This is called "version control" and git is the most widely used version control system in the world today.

The other important thing that version control systems like git enable is the ability for multiple people to collaborate on a codebase together. That is to say, git makes it possible for many people to be working on different parts of a codebase, and even the same parts of a codebase, together without worrying about destroy each others changes. You can think of it as an elegant way to parallelize work across an entire development team. This notion of people around the world being able to write code together is a powerful idea, and is what underpins the development of pretty much all of the software you use today. 

So, that's git in a nutshell. It's great.

## What is GitHub?

As great as git is, it does not itself expose a particularly friendly user interface for managing your code and collaborating with other people. Git can be thought of as really powerful infrastructure. 

Enter GitHub. GitHub is a code repository (which means a place where you can store your code) and web application that adds a functional UI layer on top of git, making it easy for you and your team, to manage and collaborate on code together. GitHub has become *the* leading place online for professional developers to code together, and has a bustling user community. The fact of the matter is that to be taken seriously as a developer today, having an active Github profile is nearly essential—particularly as a young developer looking to showcase your skills through the code you've written.

## How does Learn use Git and GitHub?

Learn uses GitHub in two very important ways: (1) GitHub is where every lesson on Learn is stored and (2) Your Learn account is intimately tied to your GitHub account. 

First, we treat curriculum on Learn (that is, all of the lessons and code labs you'll see on the site, including this one) just as developers treat code: every lesson is actually its own repository on GitHub! The reason this is significant, is that this will allow you to interact with code that accompanies our lessons in the same way a real developer would (e.g. with a git-based workflow—more on that later). Another reason this is significant is that it means that we can use git to manage and improve the curriculum content itself. And because we've open-sourced all of this content, the whole world (that includes you!) can contribute to making changes to improve what's here. You can think of Learn, built on top of GitHub, much like Wikipedia—we want the world to work together to create the best, and most up-to-date, free curriculum that has ever existed. And this is all made possible by git's version control features. 

Second, when you signed up for Learn, we asked you to create a Github account and connect it to Learn. Now that Learn is connected to your Github account, all of the code you'll write to solve code labs on Learn will get pushed and saved to Github via the git version control system. This doesn't happen fully automatically—you'll need to do a bit of work, and we'll describe that very soon. In short, what you need to understand is that git will be used to store your code on Github and that we've created some convenient shortcuts to make this easier for you early on. You'll learn more about this workflow in the next lesson. 

## So, why is Learn built like this?

The fact that Learn is so tightly connected to GitHub using git is actually one of the most important features of Learn, and one of the things that makes it unlike any other online coding platform out there. 

The truth of the matter is that we want to teach you to code using the same tools and workflow that real developers use every day. And as it turns out, git and GitHub are those best-in-class tools. 

So, as you make progress on Learn, you'll actually be building up a GitHub profile from the get-go. Exciting, right? That means that the instant you start solving code labs on Learn, you're already a developer! There is no magic forumula to becoming a developer—you start to become one as soon as you start writing and pushing code. And guess what, you're about to starting doing that on Learn.
